#File System Test App

This is a simple Node.js file-system explorer application designed for
experimenting with Heroku and Node.js' file-system APIs. The code is heavily
influenced by [Ch 20: Node.js](http://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html) in
Eloquent Javascript. Running this application is probably a security risk,
since it returns information about all requested files/directories.

##Running locally
